# DAPS: Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors

## Overview

`DAPS` is an R package implementing the **DAP-S** (Deterministic
Approximation of Posteriors) algorithm for Bayesian genetic
fine-mapping. DAP-S combines the computational efficiency of SuSiE’s
variational approximation with the accuracy and interpretability of
Bayesian Variable Selection Regression (BVSR) model using the DAP
framework.

The method provides a **fast, scalable, and well-calibrated** approach
for identifying causal genetic variants and constructing **interpretable
signal clusters**, which enable flexible construction of credible sets.

## Installation

``` r
# install the package via devtools
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("wnbo9/DAPS")
# load the package
library(DAPS)
```

## BLAS acceleration

`DAPS` relies on linear algebra operations. When linked against an
optimized BLAS implementation-such as **OpenBLAS**, **Intel MKL**, and
**Apple’s Accelerate-framework**-`DAPS` can be substantially faster than
when using the reference (Netlib) BLAS shipped with base R. Most modern
R installations already use an optimized BLAS, but performance can vary
across systems. You can check which BLAS library your R session is using
with:

``` r
sessionInfo()
```

A simple benchmark to verify that an optimized BLAS in is use:

``` r
m <- 5000
A <- matrix(rnorm(m^2), m, m)
system.time(A %*% A)
```

As a rough guideline, an elapsed time on the order of ~1 second
indicates that your R installation is likely using an optimized BLAS.
