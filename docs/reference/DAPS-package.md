# DAPS: Deterministic Approximation of Posteriors for Bayesian fine-mapping

DAPS implements the DAP-S algorithm for Bayesian genetic fine-mapping,
integrating SuSiE's variational approximation with deterministic
posterior computation to identify causal variants and construct
interpretable signal clusters.
